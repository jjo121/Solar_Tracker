-Pulse Width Modulation
Method of controlling servo motors.
Allows to control motor with digital signals instead of analog ones.
Width of pulse correspnds to how much we want to move motor.
A certain pulse width (found in datasheet) should give the 0 position pulse.

-Transimpedance Amplifier
Acts as a buffers.
Allows us to input voltage signals into microprocessor instead of current.
Also allows us to change gain to something suitable.

-Servo Motors Work!
Replace 180 degrees servo motor with 360 degrees for the xy axis rotation
360 degree motor has oontinous rotation. We need to control speed now, not angle

-Photodiode
Sensitvitiy too low-we increased gain
Current could possibly be too high now so we think we should add a fuse

Gain on the op amp is currenttly 100K/2.2K - roughly 45x gain (5% tolerance). 
Should swap out LM741 for LM341 due to the fact that the LM341 can perfrom all the ampliying for the 4 photodiodes using one op amp rather than 4.
220k resistor between photodiode an GND (%5 tolerance).

-Servo Motors Work!
Delay of 7.5 microseconds created
This was used with an oscilloscope to generate 1.5ms delay to create 1.5ms pulse. From this position only calibration was done. Delay was reduced till motor stopped.
To stop: 1.43 to 1.48ms pulse
Will probably use pulses-->
1.42ms(4B) pulse for clockwise rotation
1.49ms(56) pulse for anticlockwise rotation
