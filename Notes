-Pulse Width Modulation
Method of controlling servo motors.
Allows to control motor with digital signals instead of analog ones.
Width of pulse correspnds to how much we want to move motor.
A certain pulse width (found in datasheet) should give the 0 position pulse.

-Transimpedance Amplifier
Acts as a buffers.
Allows us to input voltage signals into microprocessor instead of current.
Also allows us to change gain to something suitable.
